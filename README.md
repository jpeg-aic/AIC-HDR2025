## Overview

The **AIC-HDR2025** dataset is the first publicly available high-fidelity HDR image quality assessment dataset designed for precise perceptual evaluation using Just Noticeable Difference (JND) scaling. It supports benchmarking of both traditional and learning-based codecs under the JPEG AIC-3 methodology.

### Key Features

- **5 source HDR images** (Rec.2100 PQ, 10-bit RGB)
- **100 compressed images**, using 4 codecs (JPEG AI, JPEG XL, AVIF, JPEG XT), each at 5 bitrate levels
- **34,560 triplet responses** from 151 participants across 4 fully controlled labs
- **Perceptual quality scores** reconstructed in JND units with high confidence (95% CI â‰ˆ 0.27 at 1 JND)
- **Unified scale reconstruction** from both plain and boosted triplet comparisons

---

## Dataset Availability

The dataset will be **publicly released after QoMEX 2025**, which will be held in **Madrid, Spain, from September 30 to October 2, 2025**.

Upon release, this repository will include:

- HDR source images and compressed test images  
- Subjective annotations (triplet responses)  
- Reconstructed perceptual scales in JND units  
- Codec configurations and encoding recipes
